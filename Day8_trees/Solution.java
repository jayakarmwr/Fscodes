/*
 * VishnuVardan is working with Decision Trees for AI-based predictions.
To analyze alternative outcomes, Kishore has planned to flip the decision 
tree horizontally to simulate a reverse processing approach.

Rules for Flipping the Decision Tree:
	- The original root node becomes the new rightmost node.
	- The original left child becomes the new root node.
	- The original right child becomes the new left child.
This transformation is applied level by level recursively.

Note:
------
- Each node in the given tree has either 0 or 2 children.
- Every right node in the tree has a left sibling sharing the same parent.
- Every right node has no further children (i.e., they are leaf nodes).

Your task is to help VishnuVardan flip the Decision Tree while following 
the given transformation rules.

Input Format:
-------------
Space separated integers, nodes of the tree.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of nodes of flipped tree as described below.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 2 3 5 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
5 1 2 3 4


Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 2 5

Sample Output-2:
----------------
2 5 4
