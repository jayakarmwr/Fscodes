/*
 * Construct the binary tree from the given In-order and Pre-order. 
Find Nodes Between Two Levels in Spiral Order.
The spiral order is as follows:
-> Odd levels → Left to Right.
-> Even levels → Right to Left.

Input Format:
--------------
An integer N representing the number of nodes.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the in-order traversal.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the pre-order traversal.
Two integers:
Lower Level (L)
Upper Level (U)

Output Format:
Print all nodes within the specified levels, but in spiral order.

Example:
Input:
7
4 2 5 1 6 3 7
1 2 4 5 3 6 7
2 3

Output:
3 2 4 5 6 7

Explanation:
Binary tree structure:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  / \
    4   5 6  7

Levels 2 to 3 in Regular Order:
Level 2 → 2 3
Level 3 → 4 5 6 7

Spiral Order:
Level 2 (Even) → 3 2 (Right to Left)
Level 3 (Odd) → 4 5 6 7 (Left to Right)
